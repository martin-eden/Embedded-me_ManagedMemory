Managing memory segment in dynamic memory. Arduino library.

## Design

It's resizable memory segment in heap memory.

It can load data and return data segment. If fills memory with
zeroes after allocation and before deallocation.

Deallocation is hardwired to class destructor. So be careful
not to pass copy of instance by accident. Memory span in this case
will be the same and the first destructor will zero that memory.

From the other hand, it's useful for creating copies of any
binary data or ASCIIZ in dynamic memory and not worrying about
releasing their memory. Memory will be released when class instance
leave syntax scope.


## Sample output

```
[me_ManagedMemory] Okay, we are here.

  This library manages heap span.

  Class manages loading data and resizing. Free functions
  handle heap memory allocations, zeroing and copying.

  In this example we'll use one instance with different
  values. Idea is to demonstrate that memory span for data
  is reused.

  TMemorySegment (
    Start 00000
    Size 00000
    Data ()
  )

  TMemorySegment (
    Start 00857
    Size 00003
    Data ( 065 066 067 )
  )

  TMemorySegment (
    Start 00862
    Size 00005
    Data ( 049 050 051 052 053 )
  )

  TMemorySegment (
    Start 00857
    Size 00002
    Data ( 097 098 )
  )

[me_ManagedMemory] Done.
